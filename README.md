# About-Me
HI there, My name is Marykate, I also frequently go by Mk! I am a senior at Seattle Pacific Univerisity majoring in Human Development and Family Studies along with Sociology and a minor in Data Analytics. 
I care a lot about social problems and try my best to use my knowledge from both majors to inform my data analytics work. I hope to one day pursue being a social worker and maybe even go into public policy or policy research.
